Cooperation Manager is simple CRM to manage individual cooperation with teachers. This is my answer to the course "Individual project" in the 2nd year of CS studies. The main goal of the project is to learn how to create web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor, Entity Framework and Bootstrap.

## What will the system enable? Main functionalities
1. All users can browse browse the database of topics and teachers
2. Students can sign up for individual cooperation with chosen teacher
3. Teachers can add topics to the database and accept or not cooperation requests
4. Students and teachers can view history of cooperation, add notes etc (nice to have)
5. Administrators can assign roles on the site and moderate content (nice to have)

## Used patterns
1. MVC
2. Unit of Work
3. Repository
4. Dependency Injection
5. Separate service layer for business logic
